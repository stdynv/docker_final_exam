### Project Architecture

![architeture diagram](https://github.com/stdynv/docker_final_exam/blob/main/humans-best-friend/architecture.png)

### Tasks

1. Create a file called docker-compose.build.yml (not running containers). This file will be responsable for building the application images from the Dockerfile contents provided.
2. The images that are build need to be published first in your publish docker registry and then in a private registry. Please make sure you have a frontend for the private registry as we saw in the course.
3. Create another file called `compose.yml` and it will be responsible of deploying the application and all the needed containers. Please make sure that the images are referencing the one in your private registry.
